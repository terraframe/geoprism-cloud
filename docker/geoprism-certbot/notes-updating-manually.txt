# This file is for documentation purposes only.
# This text document contains notes on how to update an older server to the new certbot paradigm without redeploying it.


# TODO : The way the docker socket is mounted has changed and has not been updated in this document


1. If the server needs updates, 1. stop the docker service, 2. sudo yum update
2. If we need yum-cron, install it   https://jonathansblog.co.uk/yum-cron
3. If docker has updated and the docker containers don't work anymore due to a restart policy:
   a. docker stop postgres  
   b. Remove the 'maxRetrys' from /var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/hostconfig.json
   c. sudo service docker restart
4. Manually run steps in docker-certbot yml

# Make directories
mkdir -p /data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks
mkdir -p /data/ssl/letsencrypt/cert

# Copy files over.
vim /data/ssl/letsencrypt/cert/cli.ini
vim /data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks/post-hook.sh
vim /data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks/pre-hook.sh
vim /data/ssl/letsencrypt/geoprism-certbot.sh

# Add exeuction permissions
chmod +x /data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks/post-hook.sh
chmod +x /data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks/pre-hook.sh
chmod +x /data/ssl/letsencrypt/geoprism-certbot.sh

5. When you get to docker run command, here it is. Make sure to update your domain and keystore password

docker run -d --name geoprism-certbot --restart always --network host \
            -v "/data/tomcat/webapps/.well-known:/data/tomcat/webapps/.well-known" \
            -v "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/cert:/etc/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/lib:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/log:/var/log/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/hooks:/var/lib/geoprism-certbot/hooks" \
            -v "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/geoprism-certbot.sh:/var/lib/geoprism-certbot/geoprism-certbot.sh" \
            -v "/var/run:/var/run/parent" \
            docker:19 /var/lib/geoprism-certbot/geoprism-certbot.sh REPLACEME.geoprism.net security@terraframe.com REPLACEME geoprism
            
6. Copy tomcat ssl config file from /docker/web-private/security/server.xml to /data/ssl/server.xml

7. Modify geoprism config to mount new ssl cert, by updating "mountPoints". Make sure to change "REPLACEME" with your domain:

"MountPoints":{
    "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/geoprism.ks": {
      "Source": "/data/ssl/letsencrypt/cert/live/spatialiq.geoprism.net/keystore.jks",
      "Destination": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/geoprism.ks",
      "RW": true,
      "Name": "",
      "Driver": "",
      "Type": "bind",
      "Propagation": "rprivate",
      "Spec": {
        "Type": "bind",
        "Source": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/geoprism.ks",
        "Target": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/geoprism.ks"
      },
      "SkipMountpointCreation": false
    },
    "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml": {
      "Source": "/data/ssl/server.xml",
      "Destination": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml",
      "RW": true,
      "Name": "",
      "Driver": "",
      "Type": "bind",
      "Propagation": "rprivate",
      "Spec": {
        "Type": "bind",
        "Source": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml",
        "Target": "/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml"
      },
      "SkipMountpointCreation": false
    }
}
